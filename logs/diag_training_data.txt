groups. The code iterates over a list called 'dg' and dynamically constructs a SQL query called 'sql_dg' by concatenating strings. The constructed query combines the names and percentages of disk groups ('dgname' and 'dgpct') using the \"union all\" clause.\n\nAfter constructing the SQL query, the code includes a series of conditional statements to analyze the disk group usage. If the percentage ('dgpct') is greater than 80 and less than 95, and the free space ('dgfree') is less than 2048, a diagnostic message is appended to the 'dg_info' string indicating that the disk group usage is high and the available space is low. The 'flag_dg' variable is incremented to indicate that a disk group exceeding the threshold has been identified.\n\nSimilarly, if the percentage is greater than 80 and less than 95, but the free space is greater than 10240, another diagnostic message is appended, indicating that the disk group usage is relatively high but the available space is sufficient. Again, 'flag_dg' is incremented.\n\nIf the percentage is equal to or greater than 95, a diagnostic message is appended to 'dg_info' indicating that the disk group usage is significantly exceeding the warning limit. 'flag_dg' is incremented accordingly.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, a message indicating normal disk group usage is appended to 'dg_info'.\n\nThe final line of the code trims off the trailing \"union all\" from the constructed SQL query.\n\nIn summary, this code analyzes the usage of disk groups and provides diagnostic messages based on defined thresholds and conditions.

Note that HashJoin requires high memory consumption.\n\nThe code checks for abnormal NestLoop, HashJoin, and MergeJoin operators, and identifies inappropriate join nodes based on the number of rows and cost rate. It also provides suggestions for optimization, such as setting 'enable_hashjoin' to 'on', optimizing SQL structure to reduce JOIN cost, and using temporary tables to filter data. \n\nIf the code finds any poor join performance, it is considered a root cause of the problem.
