In view merging, the optimizer merges the query block representing a view into the query block that contains it.

View merging can improve plans by enabling the optimizer to consider additional join orders, access methods, and other transformations. For example, after a view has been merged and several tables reside in one query block, a table inside a view may permit the optimizer to use join elimination to remove a table outside the view.

For certain simple views in which merging always leads to a better plan, the optimizer automatically merges the view without considering cost. Otherwise, the optimizer uses cost to make the determination. The optimizer may choose not to merge a view for many reasons, including cost or validity restrictions.

If OPTIMIZER_SECURE_VIEW_MERGING is true (default), then Oracle Database performs checks to ensure that view merging and predicate pushing do not violate the security intentions of the view creator. To disable these additional security checks for a specific view, you can grant the MERGE VIEW privilege to a user for this view. To disable additional security checks for all views for a specific user, you can grant the MERGE ANY VIEW privilege to that user.

Note:You can use hints to override view merging rejected because of cost or heuristics, but not validity.
