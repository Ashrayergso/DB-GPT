A materialized view is a query result stored in a table.

When the optimizer finds a user query compatible with the query associated with a materialized view, the database can rewrite the query in terms of the materialized view. This technique improves query execution because the database has precomputed most of the query result.

The optimizer looks for materialized views that are compatible with the user query, and then uses a cost-based algorithm to select materialized views to rewrite the query. The optimizer does not rewrite the query when the plan generated unless the materialized views has a lower cost than the plan generated with the materialized views.
