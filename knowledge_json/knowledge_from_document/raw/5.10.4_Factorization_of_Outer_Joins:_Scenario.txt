The database supports join factorization of outer joins, antijoins, and semijoins, but only for the right tables in such joins.

For example, join factorization can transform the following UNION ALL query by factorizing t2:


Copy
SELECT t1.c2, t2.c2
FROM   t1, t2
WHERE  t1.c1 = t2.c1(+) 
AND    t1.c1 = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT t1.c2, t2.c2
FROM   t1, t2
WHERE  t1.c1 = t2.c1(+) 
AND    t1.c1 = 2
The following example shows the transformation. Table t2 now no longer appears in the UNION ALL branches of the subquery.


Copy
SELECT VW_JF_1.item_2, t2.c2
FROM   t2, (SELECT t1.c1 item_1, t1.c2 item_2
            FROM   t1
            WHERE  t1.c1 = 1
            UNION ALL
            SELECT t1.c1 item_1, t1.c2 item_2
            FROM   t1
            WHERE  t1.c1 = 2) VW_JF_1
WHERE  VW_JF_1.item_1 = t2.c1(+)
