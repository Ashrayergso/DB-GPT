The key optimization of in-memory aggregation is to aggregate while scanning.

To optimize query blocks involving aggregation and joins from a single large table to multiple small tables, such as in a typical star query, the transformation uses KEY VECTOR and VECTOR GROUP BY operations. These operations use efficient in-memory arrays for joins and aggregation, and are especially effective when the underlying tables are in-memory columnar tables.
