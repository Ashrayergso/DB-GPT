UNION ALL queries are common in database applications, especially in data integration applications.

Often, branches in a UNION ALL query refer to the same base tables. Without join factorization, the optimizer evaluates each branch of a UNION ALL query independently, which leads to repetitive processing, including data access and joins. Join factorization transformation can share common computations across the UNION ALL branches. Avoiding an extra scan of a large base table can lead to a huge performance improvement.
