If there is contention, it is considered a root cause of the issue. If there is no contention, it is not a root cause.

match_diagnose_knowledge, the high I/O bandwidth usage could be caused by the slow query identified as 'select o_orderpriority, count(*) as order_count from orders where o_orderdate >= date $1 and o_orderdate < date $2 + interval $3 month and exists ( select * from lineitem where l_orderkey = o_orderkey and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate ) group by o_orderpriority order by o_orderpriority LIMIT $4'. This query has a high total time and is called frequently. The increased 'pg_stat_database_tup_updated' indicates that the database is updating a significant number of tuples, which could be caused by this slow query. In addition, there's an increase in 'irate(node_disk_read_bytes_total' which indicates the rate at which the disk is being read. This could also be due to the slow query. 

To resolve the high I/O usage, we can consider optimizing the SQL queries especially the one with the high total time. Optimization could mean adding appropriate indexing to the database to reduce the amount of data that needs to be read from the disk. I can also recommend the use of the 'optimize_index_selection' API to help select the best indexes for the database.

If the table has too many fetched tuples and the hit rate is low, it is considered a root cause. Additionally, if there are expensive sequential scans, index scans, or heap scans, it is also considered a root cause. The function provides details on the heavy scan operator, including the number of fetched tuples, returned rows, and hit rate. It also suggests adjustments to avoid large scans. If there are expensive scans, the function suggests confirming whether the inner table has an index, avoiding count operations, and considering the index filter ability. If there is a heavy scan operator, the function provides details on the operator and suggests adjustments according to business needs. If there are no suggestions, it suggests avoiding heavy scans."}']
